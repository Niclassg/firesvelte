# FireSvelte


A strongly typed and easy to use Firebase library for SvelteKit.

Based on [SvelteFire](https://github.com/codediodeio/sveltefire) which doesn't seem to be maintained anymore.

## Improvements

- [x] Strongly typed
- [ ] Support for Realtime Database coming soon (I hope)


## Usage


```npm
npm i svelte-flame
```
